  ## Contributing
  
  To contribute to this project:
  
  The purpose of this project was to create a command line application using the inquirer package that accepts user input. Criteria includes:

- When the user runs the application and enters their responses then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
- When a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions are entered this will be added to appropriate sections of the README
- When a licence is chosen then the corresponding badge is added to the top and the licence section is generated that explains which license the application is covered under
The README displays entered GitHub name and a link to the GitHub profile within the Questions section
- When an email is entered then this is added to the same Questions section, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
When the links in the Table of Contents section are clicked then it takes me to the corresponding section of the README.
