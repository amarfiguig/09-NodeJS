# 09 NodeJS : Professional README Generator 

In this activity, you will build a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.

## User Story

AS A developer I WANT a README generator SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
* Youâ€™ll need the following tools and technologies to accomplish this:

  * `fs` for writing to the file system

  * `inquirer` version 8.2.4 for collecting user input

  * String template literals for generating a string version of the HTML document before it is written to the file system

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
* THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* WHEN I enter my project title
* THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
* WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
* THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
* WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
* THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
* WHEN I enter my GitHub username
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* WHEN I enter my email address
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
* WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
* THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README


The main challenge i faced, was getting used to using the node.js application for the first time, however, after a little practise, i found it fairly easy to use and write code that will execute when node runs. 

I also had the opportunity to practise and refine my current JavaScript skills.

I hope to optimize the the code further in the future, when i have more knowledge on node.js & JavaScript.
